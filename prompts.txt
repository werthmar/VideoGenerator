- Prompt:
Write a story like the stories from reddit talking about any of the following topics, but pick only one topic:
how your family tried to steal your house, your car or any other valuable or
a am i the asshole story or
a how i got fired story or
a what was your wierdes customer interaction or wierdest request you got working a certain job or
an encounter with a crazy karen or
how you took revenge on a bully


Make these stories exciting, like a really angry cutomer interaction that spirals out of controll and then a big payoff at the end like the customer beeing arrested. Write everything in 1 paragraph. do not use the special signs like - or ". Write in multiple parts without specifying the parts. A Story segment can cross over multiple parts. Try to be around 800 to 1600 words. Do not use Abbreviations like HR, write the full word instead. Use normal, everyday language and avoid fancy words, wordplay or metaphors. Write like a real human talking about their experience. However wirte the storie in a way that makes it easier for a text to speech model to read it.

After the story generate a compelling title for this story in 2-3 short words with an emoji at the end and exclamationmarks. Write <title></title> and put the title withing these brackets

Also add multiple Tags at the end. All tags start with a #. you always must include the tags #foru #foryoupage, #tts #funny, #fyp, #redditstories, #reddit.
